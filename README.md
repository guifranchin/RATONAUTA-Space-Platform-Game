# RATONAUTA: Space Platform Game

RATONAUTA is a space-themed platform game created with the goal of learning programming and logical reasoning. The game follows the journey of a mouse on a quest to conquer the moon, supposedly made of cheese, as the player helps the mouse jump between platforms and collect rewards. The game features an opening animation and a menu with options to Play, History, Ranking, Credits. The game mechanics include a mouse oxygen bar that decreases over time and can be recovered by jumping or oxygen cylinders, the ability to jump on solid and suspended platforms, and random platform generation with accessibility control.
